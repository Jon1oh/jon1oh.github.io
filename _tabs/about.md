Beyond academics, I pursue music and sports with a commitment to grow through curiosity, collaboration, and challenging my limits. These activities have taught me that true growth lies in embracing discomfort, shaping my resilience and versatility.

Musically, I sing with choirs like the Singapore Symphony Youth Choir (SSYC), Voices of Singapore (VOS), and Symphonia Choralis. While passion drew me to singing, the greater reward lay in collaborating with diverse people and mastering various genres. This adaptability extends to my guitar practice: I play classical and fingerstyle techniques, achieving ABRSM Grade 5 in Guitar and Theory and Grade 4 in Piano. My National Arts Council busking license also pushed me further. Busking was transformative - performing for strangers forced me to confront stage anxiety, redefining confidence as a skill honed by embracing vulnerability. Hence developing discipline and stepping outside my comfort zone.
